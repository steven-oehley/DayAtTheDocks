This is a simple one page layout to practice vanilla css and avoid some of the common pitfalls.
Such as collapsing margins, styling links and full width backgrounds with limited content width.

Techniques I used to handle this:

- Consitent spacing by turning off margin tops on typography related elements
- Turning off margin bottoms on last child elements
- content set in divs
- padding for consistant spacing inside parent elements
